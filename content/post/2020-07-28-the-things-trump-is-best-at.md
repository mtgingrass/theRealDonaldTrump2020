"I know some of you may think l'm tough and harsh but actually I'm a very compassionate person (with a [very high IQ](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/325973644276809730)) with strong common sense"

"I watch these pundits on television and, you know, they call them intellectuals. They're not intellectuals," Trump told thousands of supporters in the swing state. "I'm much smarter than them. I think [I have a much higher IQ](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-i-have-a-higher-iq-than-george-will/article/2577023). I think I went to a better college --- better everything,"

"@ajodom60: @FoxNews and as far as that low-info voter base goes, [I have an IQ of 132](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/676174398253068289). So much for that theory. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain"

Sorry losers and haters, but [my I.Q. is one of the highest](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/332308211321425920?lang=en) -and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure,it's not your fault

"He's been quite critical of you as you know. He's attacked you for being ignorant," Piers Morgan said to Trump. "[Let's do an IQ test](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/05/16/trump-challenges-london-mayor-sadiq-khan-iq-test/84436936/)," Trump interrupted

"We can't let these people, these so called egg-heads--and by the way, [I guarantee you my IQ is much higher](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/10/10/a-brief-history-of-trump-challenging-people-to-iq-tests/) than theirs, alright. Somebody said the other day, 'Yes, well the intellectuals--' I said, 'What intellectuals? I'm smarter than they are, many of people in this audience are smarter than they are."

"You know, [I'm, like, a smart person](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-president-trump-consumes--or-does-not-consume--top-secret-intelligence/2017/05/29/1caaca3e-39ae-11e7-a058-ddbb23c75d82_story.html). I don't have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years," Trump told Fox News last December.

Trump says he has "[one of the great memories of all time](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/10/25/trump_says_myeshia_johnson_s_recollection_is_wrong_and_he_has_one_of_the.html)"

Asked on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" who he talks with consistently about foreign policy, Trump responded, "I'm speaking with myself, number one, because [I have a very good brain](http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/03/trump-foreign-policy-adviser-220853) and I've said a lot of things."

" ... I think that would qualify as not smart, but genius....and [a very stable genius](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/949619270631256064) at that!"
