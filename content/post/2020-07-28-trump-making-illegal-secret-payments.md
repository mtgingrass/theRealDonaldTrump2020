Remember all those [stacks and stacks](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/01/donald-trumps-first-press-conference-as-president-elect-reviewed.html) of undifferentiated papers in unlabeled manila folders that was supposed to represent his divestiture from Trump organizations and businesses, but [it](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-press-conference-folders-business-plan-empire-blank-fake-handover-donald-jr-eric-a7523426.html) mostly just looked like blank paper stacked up for show, and then [refused](https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/313907-trump-didnt-allow-reporters-to-see-documents-detailing-split) to let the media examine the stacks of papers?

Remember when [Omarosa released a tape recording of Lara Trump offering her a $15,000 a month job with the Trump campaign to keep her quiet](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/omarosa-releases-secret-tape-lara-trump-offering-her-15k-month-n901306)?

I wonder how far $250,000,000 goes in terms of bribes and hush money payments to cheat the 2020 election.

You're right, he's a supposed billionaire. I think he always found a way to divert the money so he doesn't have to spend his own. He has a lot of side shady business not only in US but China, South Africa if I'm not mistaken, there's also those [billions of dollars ](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-administration-discloses-some-recipients-of-670-billion-small-business-bailout)that was supposed to be given to small businesses and they refused to disclose the beneficiaries of it, which went to his family and "his people".

Also, 100% sure he uses tax money to pay for them too. D junior went on a trip to Mongolia last year using around [$76,000](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/06/donald-trump-jr-mongolian-hunting-trip-cost-taxpayers-76000-secret-service) tax money to pay for it.
