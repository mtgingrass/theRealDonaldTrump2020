Remember all those [stacks and stacks](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/01/donald-trumps-first-press-conference-as-president-elect-reviewed.html) of undifferentiated papers in unlabeled manila folders that was supposed to represent his divestiture from Trump organizations and businesses, but [it](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-press-conference-folders-business-plan-empire-blank-fake-handover-donald-jr-eric-a7523426.html) mostly just looked like blank paper stacked up for show, and then [refused](https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/313907-trump-didnt-allow-reporters-to-see-documents-detailing-split) to let the media examine the stacks of papers?
